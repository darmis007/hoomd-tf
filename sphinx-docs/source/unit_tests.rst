Unit Tests
----------


You can run the unit tests directly via ``python htf/test-py/test_tensorflow.py``,
``python htf/test-py/test_utils.py``, etc. For convenience, you can also install the ``pyest`` package and run the following from the root
HOOMD-TF directory:

.. code:: bash

    pytest htf/test-py/
